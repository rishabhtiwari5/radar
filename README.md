# Radar System

## Overview:
The project is a radar system built with an Uno board that uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on top of a servo motor. The servo motor rotates back and forth within a specified range, allowing the ultrasonic sensor to scan the area in front of it. The project can display the detected object's location and distance on a connected computer or a small display. This setup mimics the behavior of a radar system, which can detect obstacles and objects within a specific range.
